<h1> Introduction</h1>
<p>

Am familiar to Both PROGCON and User experience as they are the only I.T experience I have that<br>
<em>Hobbies</em> are Drawing, Gaming, Traveling, bit of Reading and also some photography as well<br>
What I plan to do someday is to live abroad and to find the best job for me and maybe to be able to aim for higher goals in life<br>
I donâ€™t know what to expect in this course but hopefully something to help us in the future<br>
Anything that can improve us for our careers and help us understand what we need to know more about
Technology and the likes
